Agenda:

	Software Testing:

		Requirement--------------Customer, their business, their end users expectations
		Architecting Solution------Architect, Domain Expert
		Develpoment Team----------programmer, Developer,  UI Designer
		Release Team--------------Build software---Binary deployable images
	
		Software Testing----------Tester, QA, Endusers, Customers
		Operations Team------------maintainance, adminstration, Monitoring
		DevOps Team----------------	
		Zero Defect Product (Service)----------
		
		
		:then why do get to listen tester do not have growth and much salary compared to developer?
			
			QA
			Zero defect Product
			System Requirement Analysis
			Test Plan
			Test cases
			QA process
			
		tester requirement reduced by devops?---------
		
		so after cdac which role we should focus on


Software Testing:

		finding bugs
		finding loop holes in a software
		
	Quality of software:
		
		Define test plan
		Write  test cases
		Execute tests
		Collect test results

		Report test results to develpoment team

		Esclate vulenrabilities in softwarebuild
		Always check for expected output from the system


		Software testing  is a method 

			wheter the actual software (Product, service, Applicatoin)
			matches expected  requirements.
			it ensuress  software is bug free. ( Zero Defect Software)
			
			The purpose of  ST 
				identify errors, gaps
					 missing requirements

		 White Box Testing
		 Black Box Testing
		 Grey Box Testing

		Advantage of Software testing ?

			Cost Effective:
			Product Quality:
			Customer satisfaction:
			Security:

		Types of Software Testing:
			
			Functional Testing:

					  Unit Testing:
					  Integration Testing: Smoke Testing..
					  

			Non-Functional Testing(Performance Testing):
					Performance
					Endurance
					Load Testing
					Scalability
					Usability

			Maintenance:	Regression Testing

	
	Software Developement:
				Principles of Software Development

				Object Oriented Principles
					pillars of Object Oriented:
						Abstration, Encapsualtion, inheritance & Ploymorphism
						typing, concurrency, modularity, persistence
					


What  the principles of Software Testing:

7 priniciples of Software Testing::

	1. Exhaustive testing is not possible
	2. Defect Clustering
	3. Pesticide paradox
	4. Testing shows a presence of defects
	5. absence of Error----- (Zero Defect Product)
	6. Early Testing
	7. Testing is context dependent

DDD

TDD: (Test Driven Delopment)

	 How do you write a test ?
		
		1. define  a scenario
		2. define expected output
		3. define requirement input

		Module: think of ECommerce Case Study
			Membership
			User Autentication
		
		Test Plan:

		Test case:
			User Autentication:

			1.define output
				expected output:valid User
				expected output:invalid User
			2. define input
				 username
				 password
			User Registration
			Change Password:

		create muliplet test intances:
		
		Use Sampling Data :

			test 1:  username:Ravi passoword:seed          true
			test 2:  username:Sachin passoword:seed         false
			test 3:  username:Minal passoword:ibm		true
			test 4:  username:Ravi passoword:seed		false
			test 5:  username:Sandesh passoword:yuu		true
			test 6:  username:Raj passoword:ppd		true


		Now developer will write :
		
			AccountManager:
					bool	Validate ( username, password){
						bool status=false;
						//get database access
						// define SQL query
						//fire qurey to database
						//get result
						//staus=result
						return status;
					}

		Verification:(QA)
			1.Checking of documents, design,  code,
			2.Does not involve  in code execution-------------at any time
			3.Reviews, walkthroughs, inspections and chekcing resources, environment
			4.Confirms specification
			5.Find bugs before development
			6.QA Team

		Validation: (Testing)
		 	  1.Testing and validation of actual product
			  2.Involve in code execution------------------------at runtime
			  3.Black box testing, white box testing, non-functional testing
			  4.Check software meets expectations
			  5.Finds bugs which are not found during verification
			  6.Testing  Team along with QA Team





	Today: 28/5/2021
	
	Software Testing:
		Black Box Test
		White Box Test
		Gray Box Test
		 
	Integration Testing 
		 

	Test Plan
	Regression Testing----------------got 
	Create test case document for different sprints (designed in SE)
	Testing Frameowrk:
		library-------Executable
		JUnit is a unit testing framework-------Java Application---------Spring Boot -------.jar files (.class files)
		NUnit is a unit testing framework-------.NET Application---------asp.net core-------dll files
		Jasmine is unit testing framework ------Javascript Framework-----Node js-----------.javascript
		PyTest  is a unit testing framework-----Python  Appliation--------py---------------.py


		Framwork:
			  ( reusable components)
			  ( in the form librarry)
			  ( classes, interfaces, data Types, inbuilt utility funcationalities)
			  ( classes, interface, data types, metadata ----annotations)
			  

		selinium Web Driver:
				
				Device Driver: it is kernel mode compiled program to control Device

		MySQL jdbc Driver:
				It is kind of Java compiled program (.class or .jar file) to control or manager database mysql
		
		Oracle jdbc Driver:
				It is kind of Java compiled program (.class or .jar file) to control or manager database oracle
		SQL jdbc Driver:
				It is kind of Java compiled program (.class or .jar file) to control or manager database jdbc

		
		Selinium Web Driver:
				Selenium WebDriver is a web framework that permits you to execute cross-browser tests.

						
			 Cross-Browser tests.
					need to writes tests for those Browser UI TEst


		JUnit :
			it is kind of Java compiled packages used for Java program unit Testing
		
		Jasmine:
			 unit test for Javascript , typscript program
					-------these frameworks are not given in the form exes....

						packages-----need tobe installed on  your PC

		Ractive :
		Proactive


		QA:.Quality Assurance: Verfication

			prevents defects
			It does not involve executing the program
			Proactive :.............
			Define guidlines, rules, policies for  delivarables
			QA involves in full software development life cycle
			
			
		QC:Quality Control:Validation
			is a part for software Testing
			to ensure the quality of software products or services.
			always involves executing a program
			 Reactive measure
			 in full software testing life cycle
	



		
						
		Mannual Testing:

	
		 Automation Testing :
				more resource.
				go those tests to be automated which can not be acheived by using Mannual testing

				


			sir is any validation required for test that we created..?

		
		Test tool selection
			
			Define the scope of automation
			Planning, Design and Development
			Test Exeuction
			Framework
			prdict Benifits of Testing;

		White Box Testing:
				input data---------product----------result

		Black Box Testing:

				input data-----block box-----result

		Gray Box Testing:

				White + black===Grey

				input data  Product-----------------------------------------result
					    product binary code + configuratin files
