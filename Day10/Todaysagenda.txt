State Management:
Each Web application is based on request -response cycle
Each Web application is based on HTTP protocol
HTTP protocol is state less by nature.
Every web application is state less by default.

ECommerce Application:
Product Catalog----------------database
Shopping Cart-----------------session
	a container is maintained for each user who is interested in purchasing products from product catalog.
each session is going to be uniquly identifed by session Id. Session ID is always created at the time session creation at server. every time sesion ID is sent to client side in the form of 
cookie.

Cookies are resent by client application back to server.
Using session id which is kept inside cooked , sever will be able to identify session created by same customer who visited before in consecutive requests.

Each session has defiend with expiration time duration

Because of session implementation , state less web application will behave like statefull application.
Web Application will serve multiple customer requests and maintain isolation between each 
user specific data at server side for certain time interval.
