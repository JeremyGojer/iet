What is Kubernetes ?
K8s Architecture
Main K8s Components
MiniKube and Kubectl - Local Setup
Main Kubectl Commands -K8s CLI
K8s YAML Configuration File
Handson Demo.


Advanced Concepts

K8s Namespaces - Organize your components
K8s Ingress
Helm package manager
Level of Volums abstractions
K8s StatefulSet  - Deploying stateful Apps
K8s Services


What is Kubernetes ?

	Official Defintion
		Open source container orchestration tool 
		developed by Google
		helps you manage containerized applications in different enviornments
		(physical or virtual  or cloud)




	What Problems does Kubernetes Solve ?
	What are the tasks of an orchestration tool ?



	The need for a container orchestration tool
		Trend from Monolith to Microservices
		Increased  usuage of containers


Demand for a proper way of managing those hundreds of containers 




What features do orchestration tools offer ?
	1.High availability or no downtime
	2.Scalability or high performance
	3.Disaster recovery - backup and restore


Kubernetes Components
	Volumes
	Pod
	Service
	Ingress

	Secrets
	CoinfigMap

	StatefulSet
	Deployment



Node and Pod

	Pod: Smallest unit of K8s
	     Abstraction over container
	     usually 1 application per Pod
	     Each Pod gets its own IP address
	     New IP address on re-creation.
	


	Services and Ingress
		permanent IP Address
		lifecycle of Pod and Service not connected.
		
		


App should be accessible through browser
	External Service  http://124.89.101.2:8080	https://my-app.com  ------ingress
	Internal Service


ConfigMap and Secret

	Database URL usually in the built application
	
		rebuild ---->push it to rep----> pull it in your pod

	ConfigMap----
		External configuration of your application.
		Don't put credentials  into ConfigMap
	
	Secret:
		used to store secret data
		Stored in base64 encoded format




______________________________________________________________________________________________________

Volumes:
	
	Data Storage
	

	Volume: Storage on local machine
		or remote outside of the k8s cluster
		
	k8s cluster 
		storage:
			1, 2

		K8s does not manage data persistence.
		


Deployment and Stateful Set

	Replicating everything on multiple servers
	
	Service is a kind of load balancer.
	
	Define blueprint for my-app pod (deployment)


	in kubernetes you are creating blue prints for my-app pods
		      you create Deployments

	

	Deployment is one more abstraction of Pods

	

	DB can not be replicated via deployment !

	
	Avoid data inconsistencies

	
	StatefulSet:
		for stateful apps

	Deployment for stateLESS apps

	StatefulSet for stateFUL Apps or Databases

	
	
	Deploying StatefulSet not easy. in K8s
	
	DB are often hosted outside of K8s cluster

	
_____________________________________________________________________________________


Basic Architecture of Kubernetes:

Master and Slave node


Worker Machine in K8s Cluster:

	Each Node has multiple Pods on it
	3 processes must be installed on every Node
	Worker Nodes do the actual work

	Process:
	1.Container runtime (docker)
	2.Kubelet--- interacts with both the container and node
		     Kubelet starts the pod with a container inside.
	3.Kube Proxy
		    -forwards the requests 

	

So, how do you interact with this cluster ?

	How to :
	1.schedule pod ?
	2.monitor ?
	3. re-schedule/ re-start pod ?
	4.join a new Node ?




All these managing processes are done by master node

Master processes:
		
		1. API Server   :	 like a cluster gateway
					 acts a gatekeeper for authentication.
		2. Scheduler	:	scheduler just decided  on which node new pod should be sheduled

		3. Controller manager:	detects cluster state changes

		4. etcd		:	etcd is the cluster brain
					cluster changes get stored in the key value store.
				
		


Example  Cluster Set-Up
		2 master node
		3 worker nodes

	Add new Master/Node server:
	1.Get new bare server
	2.Install all the master/worker node processes
	3.Add it to the cluster


		

MiniKube and Kubectl
	What is minikube
	What is kubectl
	Set-up Minikube cluster

	

What is minikube ?

	Creates Virtual Box on your latop
	Node runs in that virtual box
	1 Node K8s cluster
	for testing purpose


What is kubectl ?
	inteact with cluster
	Command line tool for K8s  cluster
		 


Installation:
	Virtualization  on your machine needed.
	
	Step1 : install hypervisor
	


Layers of Abstration
Deployment manages a Replica set
ReplicaSet manages Pods
Pod is an abstraction of Container
Container is execution.

Everything below deployment is handled by Kubernetes.





CRUD Commands:

Create deployment		kubectl create deployment [name]
Edit deployment			kubectl edit deployment [name]
Delete deployment		kubectl delete deployment [name]


Status of different k8s components
	kubectl get nodes  | pod | services | replicaset | deployment


Debugging pods

log to console			kubectl logs [pod name]
get Interactive Terminal	Kubectl exec -it [pod name] -- bin/bash
get Info about Pod		kubectl descrivbe pod [pod name]

Use configuration file for CRUD 

apply a configuration file	kubectl apply -f [file name]
Delete with configuration file 	kubectl delete -f [file name]

YAML  Configuration File in Kubernetes

overview : 
	The 3 parts of configuration file
	Connecting Deployments to service to Pods
	Demo

	
1.metadata
2.specification

3.status  : self healing 



Where does K8s get this status data?

etcd holde the current status of any k8s component.

format of configuration file YAML

"Human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages.

Syntax: strict indentation !   use YAML validators

store the config fiel with your code.
